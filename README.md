# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Python
1. Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of this excercise is to provide the candidate and county results in a voter election. These results should include total and percentage vote breakdowns, and highlight the winning candidate and county.

2. Election-Audit Results: 
- There were 369,711 votes total
- Number and Percentage of Votes per County:
    - Jefferson: 10.5% of total votes; 38,855 votes total
    - Denver: 82.8% of total votes; 306,055 votes total
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% of total votes; 24,801 votes total
- Jefferson County had the largest number of votes (306,055 votes, 82.8% of total vote)
- Number and Percentage of Votes per Candidate:
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of total votes; 85,213 votes total
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% of total votes; 272,892 votes total
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of total votes; 11,606 votes total
- Diana DeGette had the largest number of votes (272,892 votes, 73.8% of total vote)

3. Election-Audit Summary:
- This script can be used for any election as it effectively captures the requested data points (surveying the candidates and counties by voting totals and percentages). My recommendations to improve this script would be to:
    - Include a wider spectrum of voter demographics to understand the voter base (i.e. gender, ethnicity, household income, household size, etc.)
    - Include not only the counties, but also the cities because each city within a county may have different socioeconomic factors that contribute to the vote totals and percentages.
